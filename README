For the supported kernel type for this BSP, please check the TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES
by running 'bitbake -e virtual/kernel | grep "^TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES="'.

3. Board Specific Patches
=========================

To get a list of patches applied to the kernel specific to this BSP
along with patch descriptions use git whatchanged on the default
kernel (git whatchanged <kernel_type>..<bsp_name>). For example:

  # cd tmp-glibc/work-shared/<bsp_name>/kernel-source
  # git whatchanged v6.6/standard/base..v6.6/standard/nxp-sdk-6.6/nxp-soc


4. Boot Instructions
====================

The typical u-boot settings apply to these boards. You will need to use
setenv, printenv and saveenv, to configure, display and store respectively
your network configuration details and kernel command line. In order to
TFTP a kernel, you need at a minimum to set the following:

	- ipaddr
	- gatewayip
	- netmask
	- serverip
	- loadaddr
	- dtbfile
	- dtbaddr
	- ethaddr
	- eth1addr

Target specifics are usually set in the "bootargs" variable, and the
kernel image is set in the "kernelfile" variable. Don't forget that if you
want these values to be available after a power cycle you will need to run
the saveenv command.

Typically convenience macros exist that will create a complete bootargs
command line for the kernel based on variables that contain individual
settings.  Since these macros exist as env variables themselves, they
may or may not be present depending on who installed and configured
u-boot for the board.

The console device for the board is ttyS0 at 115200 baud. For the DTB
address, 0x90000000 was used with success by Wind River. The load address
must be high enough to not interfere with kernel decompression. A value
of 0x81000000 was used with success for all kernels tested by Wind River.

4.1 NFS Root File System
------------------------

Example settings for the monitor (u-boot) are shown below:

nfsboot=setenv bootargs root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=$serverip:$rootpath \
ip=$ipaddr:$serverip:$gatewayip:$netmask:$hostname:$netdev:off \
console=$consoledev,$baudrate $othbootargs;tftp $kernel_addr_r $kernelfile; \
tftp $fdt_addr_r $fdtfile;booti $kernel_addr_r - $fdt_addr_r
ethaddr=00:04:9F:02:00:FD
eth1addr=00:04:9F:02:01:FD
eth2addr=00:04:9F:02:02:FD
kernel_addr_r=0x81000000
fdt_addr_r=0x90000000
gatewayip=192.168.1.1
netmask=255.255.255.0
ipaddr=192.168.1.100
serverip=192.168.1.2
netdev=eth0
kernelfile=Image
fdtfile=fsl-ls1043a-rdb-sdk.dtb
rootpath=/tftpboot/rootfs
consoledev=ttyS0
baudrate=115200
othbootargs=earlycon=uart8250,mmio,0x21c0500

5. Program NXP bootloader image
===============================

5.1. On-Board NOR Flash vbank Configuration
-------------------------------------------

NOR flash is divided into 8 virtual banks named vbank0 to vbank7.
Depending on on-board switch configuration or CPLD registers; software
boots from vbank0 and vbank4. The default on-board switch configuration
boots the board from vbank0. The board can boot from vbank4 by using
the qixis_reset altbank command from the vbank0 u-boot prompt.

The RDB comes pre-loaded with all binaries in vbank0.
Users are able to program images in 2 separate virtual flash banks (vbank0
and vbank4). Images in vbank0 are locked to prevent accidental erasure or
corruption. Initially, the same images are also programmed in vbank4. This
bank is not locked so users have the option to download and program new
images into vbank4 as needed. The instructions below list commands to
download images to vbank4 and to boot from vbank4. Note that vbank4 is also
referred to as the alternate bank.

5.2. NXP bootloader image
-------------------------

WRLinux product provides a solution to build bootloader image which contains U-Boot, RCW, etc.
Please refer to section 8 to build NXP bootloader image.

After building, the bootloader image(firmware_ls1043ardb_uboot_<boot-type>.img) is generated
in directory <building-path>/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/nxp-ls1043.

And then burn it to the target board under the U-Boot prompt using the commands below:

=> tftp a0000000 firmware_ls1043ardb_uboot_norboot.img
=> protect off 64000000 +$filesize && erase 64000000 +$filesize &&
cp.b a0000000 64000000 $filesize

Then use

=> cpld reset altbank

to switch to vbank4.

5.3. NXP SDK user manual
-------------------------

To get more details about above descriptions, please refer to instructions
mentioned in the sections

	"4.8 Layerscape LDP memory layout and Userland"
and
	"4.7.5 Quick start guide for LS1043ARDB"

in the NXP's SDK user manual

	"LLDPUG_RevL6.1.1-1.0.0.pdf".

6. Creating Partitioned Images(WIC)
===================================

User can use the OpenEmbedded Image Creator, wic, to create the properly
partitioned image on a SD card. The wic command
generates partitioned images from existing OpenEmbedded build artifacts.
User can refer to the below URL to get more WIC details:

https://docs.yoctoproject.org/dev-manual/wic.html

This BSP supports disk images for SD card.
After build the project, user will get a WIC image under the directory
tmp-glibc/deploy/images/<bsp name>/ ,such as:

WIC image for SD card:
tmp-glibc/deploy/images/nxp-ls1043/wrlinux-image-std-nxp-ls1043.wic


Then user can write the output image to a SD card. WIC image contains kernel,
dtb and rootfs. User still need to write fman microcode image to SD card by "dd" command.

To change default booting configuration in uboot, user can overwrite following
variable in uboot and save to SD by saveenv command:

- kernelfile, define kernel image file name.
- fdtfile, define device-tree image file name.
- othbootargs, define additional booting parameters pass to kernel.

6.1 Burn images to SD card
--------------------------

To burn images to SD card, user needs to follow two steps:

1) Generate WIC image with NXP bootloader

WRLinux product provides a solution to build WIC image with NXP bootloader.
Please refer to section 8 for the detailed description.
After building, the WIC image(wrlinux-image-std-nxp-ls1043.wic) is generated
in directory <building-path>/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/nxp-ls1043.

2) Burn WIC image

# dd if=wrlinux-image-std-nxp-ls1043.wic of=/dev/your_sd_dev

6.2 Set board switch
--------------------

Board can boot from SD card by setting sw4[1:8] as '00100000' and sw5[1:8] as '00100010'.
After power up, if a bootable SD card inserted, then system will boot from SD
card.

7.2 kexec/kdump
---------------

To build the boot or capture kernel, use the following option with the configure
command for your project:

     --templates feature/kexec feature/kdump

To reserve a memory region for the capture kernel, pass "crashkernel=512M"
via the U-Boot command line.

NOTES:
1. Use Image as a secondary kernel. It can be found in the directory
   tmp-glibc/deploy/images/nxp-ls1043/Image

2. 512 MB (the size of the memory reserved for crash kernel) is the
   recommended amount of memory. If you add more features to the kernel, you
   can increase this value to accommodate the capture kernel.

3. Kdump
   SMP is unsupported in the 2nd kernel, so user needs to append argument "maxcpus=1"
   in the 2nd kernel bootargs.
   Because the 2nd kernel runs under limited resource, it should not work as a
   "replacement" kernel. In contrast, the only purpose of the 2nd kernel is to collect
   the crashing information of the 1st kernel.

4. Same with SDK, DPAA1 should be compiled out while creating the image for
   dump-capture 2nd kernel. With "CONFIG_FSL_SDK_DPAA_ETH=n"
   in the kernel .config setting to disable DPAA1, user can choose PCIe device "CONFIG_E1000E=y"
   as a replacement to make NFS working.
   Please refer to the chapter 7.6 "kdump/kexec User Manual" of "LLDPUG_RevL6.1.1-1.0.0.pdf".

For more detailed information about kdump, please refer to
Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt in the kernel source tree.

7.3 DPDK
--------

7.3.1 Install DPDK
------------------

Refer to the README file in dpdk feature directory(layers/wrlinux/templates/feature/dpdk).

7.4 LS1023A mode
----------------

Enable LS1023A mode by setting sw5[3] as 0.
SW5[3] definition for LS1043A processor as below:
 0: Disable cores 3 and 4
 1: Enable all cores (default value)

Note:
When booting up system with LS1023A mode, please use fsl-ls1023a-rdb-sdk.dtb file.


8. Build Bootloader
===================

Because of license limitation, the NXP ls1043 bootloader is not supported on WRLinux product.
But the necessary recipe files of building bootloader have been integrated into WRLinux product. In this way,
the customers can build bootloader for NXP ls1043 platform based on WRLinux product by themselves.
To build bootloader image for NXP ls1043 platform, it only needs to add below contents in local.conf file,
and then build WRLinux image as usual.

	BB_NO_NETWORK = '0'
	ACCEPT_FSL_EULA = "1"
	CUSTOMER_BUILD_BOOTLOADER = "1"
	CUSTOMER_RECIPES:meta-qoriq += 'secure-boot-qoriq'
	CUSTOMER_RECIPES:meta-qoriq += 'u-boot-qoriq'
	CUSTOMER_RECIPES:meta-qoriq += 'qoriq-atf'
	CUSTOMER_RECIPES:freescale-layer += 'fm-ucode'
	CUSTOMER_RECIPES:freescale-layer += 'qe-ucode'
	CUSTOMER_RECIPES:freescale-layer += 'qoriq-cst-native'
	CUSTOMER_RECIPES:freescale-layer += 'uefi'
	CUSTOMER_RECIPES:freescale-layer += 'rcw'
	CUSTOMER_RECIPES:freescale-layer += 'ls2-phy'

Note: If customers want to integrate bootloader into their own product, they MUST consult NXP and their own
      legal department.
